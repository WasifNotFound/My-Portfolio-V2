## 🎨 Customization Guide

### Changing Colors

Open `css/style.css` and edit the `:root` section:

```css
:root {
  --accent-purple: #667eea; /* Change this to your favorite color */
  --accent-violet: #764ba2; /* Secondary accent color */
  --accent-teal: #1abc9c; /* Third accent color */
}
```

### Adding Your Photo

1. Save your photo as `profile.jpg` in the `images/` folder
2. Make sure it's a square image (same width and height) for best results
3. The code will automatically make it circular!

### Updating Content

All content is in `index.html`. Look for these sections:

- **Hero Section** - Your name and title (line ~25)
- **About Cards** - Your hobbies (line ~65)
- **Projects** - Your future goals (line ~95)
- **Contact** - Your email (line ~115)

### Adding New Sections

1. Add HTML in `index.html`
2. Add styling in `css/style.css`
3. Add interactivity in `js/script.js` (if needed)
